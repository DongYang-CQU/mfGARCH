# mfGARCH - a tidyverse-garch package

This is some description about my tgarch-package.

Right now, you need the Rcpp-package to compile it on your own computer.

Please cite as ...

midasr: no GARCH-MIDAS

Better: HAC standard errrors, nice with df like lm, 

no formulas yet only GJR-GARCH, only one variable
